Sure! Here are very simple bash examples showing how >>, <<, and | work:

------------>>-----------------
🔁 >> — Append output to a file
bash
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
    echo "Hello" >> log.txt
    ✅ Appends "Hello" to the end of log.txt. If the file doesn't exist, it creates it.



---------<<---------------
🧾 << — Here document (multi-line input)
bash
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
    cat << END
    Line 1
    Line 2
    END
✅ Prints:

scss
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
Line 1
Line 2
Everything between << END and the closing END is sent to cat as input.


----------PIPE--------
🔗 | — Pipe output to another command
bash
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
    echo "HELLO" | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z'
    ✅ Converts "HELLO" to "hello" by piping it through tr.
